Learning Notes
==============

This section contains all concepts, ideas and methods that I have found useful and interesting.

.. note::

    When you write something, think of all the readers that may read your notes, so you need to write in a way that is easy to understand and satisfy the needs of each group of readers. For example, if you are writing for a non-expert audience, you need to avoid using jargon and explain the concepts clearly. If you are writing for an expert audience, you need to provide enough details and context so that they can understand the whole picture.

    Use examples that are familar with your audience so that you can lift them up to the level that you want to illustrate. Otherwise you will lose your audience really quickly. And they will not think that "Hey, he's too smart." They will think "He doesn't know what he's talking about." That's a very bad impression.
