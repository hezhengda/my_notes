Scientific writing and research methodology
=============================================

Scientific writing
--------------------

There are two things that we need to consider when writing a research paper:

- What we want to say, which is the content of the paper.
- How we want to say it, which is the form of the paper.

First we need to figure out what to say, or change another way of saying it, we need to figure out what is allowed to say in a scientific paper, for this we would need some "classification".

Here are all the things that we are allowed to say in a scientific paper, I have divided them into different sections:

.. admonition:: Introduction 

    - describe what we did in this paper.

.. admonition:: Results 

    - Describe the figures, and try to say something general, also give the outliers if you have found any.
    - Try to find connections between different papers, in this way it enriches your results, make them more consistent.
    - Show exact numbers of some special case (need examples to make reader understand what you are talking about).

.. admonition:: General 

    - Color! Color! Color! Choose, compare different colors, this is vital.
    - Generate the whole figure use codes, do not use PPT to organize the figure. Learn to use matplotlib to customize everything, and put all the parameters in the input parameters of your plotting function. Each different plots will be written in different functions, and use :code:`ax` to assign the axes that it will be plotted on. Later we can set :code:`fig, axes=plt.subplots()` to set the layout of the figure, and then put every ax in the figure. This has been proven to be a very effective way to generate figures for the manuscript, and it is also easy to modify later.

The following two videos are from the director of the writing program (Larry McEnerney) in University of Chicago. He talked about some really ground-breaking ideas about how to understand scientific community and write important research.

In the perseptive of Larry McEnerney, here are the key points that I learned:

- Know your audience, know what they want to know, and write to them.
- Knowledge is growing over time, based on the conversation between people. Some knowledge will be left behind, some will be found to be wrong and discarded, and new knowledge will be added. It's a dynamic process, not a static one.
- You need to build problems and trying solve them, paper is like the "advertisement" of your research, it is not a summary of your research.
- You don't need to show you know everything, but you need to show other people "why do they need to care about your research".

The following two videos are from Microsoft Research, which were presented by Simon Peyton Jones, a famous computer scientist from Microsoft Research.

Research methodology
----------------------

.. important::

    How to think about the importance of using AI in research? From gathering information, generate ideas, doing calculation and analysis, writing reports, and even communicating with other people. AI can be super useful in all these aspects.

This is a great video about how to do research (especially how to do good literature review) by Prof. 彭明辉.
