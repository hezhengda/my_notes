MatGL
======

In this section, we will introduce the `MatGL <https://github.com/materialsvirtuallab/matgl>`_ package, which implements an graph neural network potential for crystal simulations. MatGL (Materials Graph Library) is a powerful tool for developing accurate and efficient machine learning models for atomic-scale simulations, particularly in crystalline materials.

We will explore both the theoretical foundations and practical applications of MatGL in the following subsections.
