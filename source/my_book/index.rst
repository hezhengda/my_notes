Treatise of computational chemistry
=====================================

This is my textbook about computational chemistry, in which we will start from quantum mechanics and build up to all the modern approaches and tricks of the trades.

.. admonition:: Note

    This book will be constructed based on the problems that we are facing, it will be like a "problem-solving" game, where we want to investigate the properties of the chemical system. And we will meet many difficulties along the way, and need to use different methods in order to solve them, or at least make them tractable.

Here is the preliminary outline of the book, which I will keep updating as I write the book.
