.. admonition:: What do I do?

   I teach computer to explore the chemical space.

I love **computer science** and **chemical science**. Both of them can be shortened as "CS", which is also my favorite POV shooting game.

I hate vague languages and unclear technical details frequently found in academic papers. I think science should be fun, and technical details are super important for effective communimcation between researchers. That's why I started this website, to share what I have learned and make jokes along the way. Hope you enjoy reading them!

Dirac's paper that inspired the field of computational chemistry: `Quantum Mechanics of Many-Electron Systems <https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rspa.1929.0094>`__

I will write a textbook about computational chemistry, it will have the foundation of this field, which I think is very important for discover new materials and gaining deeper insights into the world around us.
