- A very good explanation of why sometimes you don't need to pursuit "understanding" of everything. Maybe it is not just the time for you.

- Things that I would like to do in the afternoon:

    - ✅ Edit the code for the synegistic and antagnistic effect in aqueous stability project. 
    - ✅ Finish using the code :code:`pymatviz` to plot the periodic table of elements, it looks really cool!
    - Add the documentation in the :code:`research_notes` directory. Remember to document all the important details.
    - Try to use the snippets function in :code:`cursor`, and try to figure out more interesting ways to use it, and make my productivity really high!
    - Organize all the functions in a python file, so that different functions can be reused easily. This can also make the code more readable.
